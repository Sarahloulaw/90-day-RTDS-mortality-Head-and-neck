# Introduction


The __90-day mortality after radical radiotherapy in England__ report is produced by the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) team as part of the NDRS RTDS Partnership with NHS England (NHSE) to support the NHS Long Term Plan and the Radiotherapy Transformation Plan. It presents the 90-day mortality after radical radiotherapy metric for patients with head and neck cancer treated in England. 

This metric presented in this report is a quality indicator intended for assessing the appropriate and safe delivery of radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancers can result in life-threatening side-effects, particularly when combined with systemic anti-cancer therapy. This is a consequence of the anatomical site of treatment resulting in a risk of aspiration pneumonia and nutritional compromise due to radiotherapy side-effects, in addition to the risk of immuno-suppression due to concurrent chemotherapy. As a result this patient group require significant support whilst undergoing treatment. In addition, many patients will also have other medical conditions which impact upon their physiological reserve and increase their risk of death within 90 days of the start of radical radiotherapy. 

The metric does not incorporate baseline patient characteristics (such as cancer stage, age or co-morbidity) or distinguish between disease-related, treatment related and co-morbidity related death. Clinical decision-making can be challenging where both a radical and palliative approaches can be taken. Consequently, a provider with high use of radical radiotherapy (sometimes referred to as more aggressive treatment decision-making) may be found to have higher than expected 90-day mortality in the same way as one where support services are less robust than necessary. As such, where a provider is identified as outlying, there is a need to recognise all these factors when considering how best to incorporate this information into future decision-making and service planning.

Crude 90-day mortality rates were calculated based on the first radical radiotherapy episode a patient had in a year and are reported for each financial year and individual NHS Trust. The crude 90-day mortality rate is the percentage of patients who died within 90 days of the start of their first radiotherapy episode in the financial year. This report provides an opportunity to review and improve clinical practice, and may identify any NHS Trust data submission issues. The RTDS team is committed to working with NHS Trusts to help address data submission issues if they are identified.

# Methodology {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}



## Data sources {-}


The National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), part of the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) within NHS England is responsible for the collection, quality assurance and analysis of radiotherapy data from all English NHS Acute Trust providers of radiotherapy (or private facilities where delivery is funded by the NHS). There are 49 NHS Acute Trusts delivering external beam radiotherapy in England. NCRAS receives monthly submissions of standardised radiotherapy activity data and produces the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/ndrs/data/data-sets/rtds/" target="_blank">Radiotherapy Data Set (RTDS)</a>. 

For this report we used data from RTDS and focused on radiotherapy activity taking place between April 2022 and March 2024. The date of death for each patient comes from the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics/" target="_blank">Personal Demographics Service</a> via the Demographics Batch Service. Certain restrictions (criteria) were applied to the data to ensure appropriate patients and treatments were selected for inclusion in the analysis. The details of the restrictions applied can be found in the Analysis Cohort section. These restrictions mean that some Trusts may not have all of their data included in the report because their patients and patientsâ€™ treatment activity did not fit the criteria applied.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis cohort {-}

The analysis cohort contains 13,394 patients treated with radical radiotherapy which met the following inclusion criteria outlined below and had a treatment starting date within the selected time frame. 

### Patient criteria {-}

-   Aged 18 and over at the start of the radiotherapy episode
-   Patients who received treatment at an English NHS Trust, including patients who were not residents in England at the time of diagnosis or treatment
-   The patient has a valid English/Welsh NHS number

### Treatment criteria {-}

-   Radiotherapy started between 1st April 2022 and 31st March 2024
-   The treatment intent recorded by the clinician was radical
-   The episode was delivered using external beam radiotherapy
-   Radiotherapy was delivered for cancer defined by ICD10 codes: C00 - C14 or C30 - C32

### Trust coverage {-}

Over time the number of NHS Trusts that deliver radiotherapy has changed due to mergers or closures. The total number of NHS Trusts reported in the analysis changed from 50 in 2022/23 to 49 in 2023/24. Unless otherwise stated, historical data is reported under trust code and trust name as of March 2024 (the end of the analysis reporting period), not under the historic trust codes and names that existed during the time period that the data reports on. In addition, for this analysis, and in line with other RTDS Quality Metrics, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust (RBV) radiotherapy activity delivered at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (RM3) was included and reported under The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Analysis {-}



### Patient approach {-}

The analytical methodology for calculating the 90-day mortality following radical radiotherapy examines all radical radiotherapy episodes delivered to patients for head and neck cancer in a given financial year, with the metric calculated at a person level for each financial year. This patient approach, which is based on the patient's first radical radiotherapy episode in a year, was chosen as it accounts for the possibility of fragmented episodes, and clinically it is expected that a patient will only receive one radical episode in a year period (between 0.2% and 0.5% of patients had more than one radical radiotherapy episode for head and neck cancer in a year). Therefore, in the context of this analysis, 90-day mortality refers to the proportion of patients treated with radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer where the patient died within 90 days of the start date of the first radical episode received in a given year. Patients can contribute to multiple yearly 90-day mortality rates if they had radical radiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancer starting in different years. 

### Flagging episodes where the patient died within 90 days {-}

For every patient, we calculated the time interval between the patient's start date of their first radical episode in a given year and the death date of the patient receiving the episode of care or the recorded date of vital status for patients who were still alive (all alive patients had a vital status date of 5th January 2025 or later). From this, a 90-day mortality flag was then created for each patient to identify the patients who died within 90 days following the start of their first radical episode. It should be noted that this calculation includes deaths from all causes. This is because the cause of death can be misclassified, especially in relation to deaths during cancer treatment. In addition, clinical decision-making in radical radiotherapy should be holistic, recognising factors relating to the cancer, treatment and patient (including their prognosis and co-morbidities) in the decision to treat and to fractionate. As such, the decision was made to take an inclusive approach to cause of death for this report. 

The analysis includes 1 (less than 0.1%) patient with a radical radiotherapy episode with a duration longer than 90 days, measured as the interval between the first and last appointment date in the episode. By definition, this patient can only contribute to the total number of radical episodes (denominator), and not to the total number of episodes where death occurred within 90 days (numerator). Whilst retrospectively it is clear that the patient survived beyond 90 days, prospectively this cannot be known. Therefore to ensure all clinical decisions were captured this patient's episode was included in the analysis.


### Crude 90-day mortality rates {-}

We calculated yearly patient-level crude 90-day mortality rates for England and each English NHS Trust. The 90-day mortality rates were calculated by financial year based on the patient's first radical radiotherapy episode starting in the respective year. Patients were identified where the patient was reported to have died within 90 days, inclusive, of the start of the episode. The annual crude 90-day mortality rate was calculated as the observed proportion of patients treated with radical radiotherapy where the patient died within 90 days of the start of their first radical episode in a year out of the total number of patients treated with radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer in a financial year. 
  
<br>
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Crude 90-day Mortality Rate} = \frac{\text{The number of episodes starting in the financial year} \\\text{where the patient died within 90 days, inclusive}}{\text{The total number of radical radiotherapy} \\\text{episodes starting in the financial year}} * 100
\end{align}
$$

# Interpreting the data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


## Interpreting the rates {-}


There is no 'target' 90-day mortality following radical radiotherapy, indeed, aiming for a 90-day mortality of 0% would inevitably result in under treatment of individuals who might otherwise stand to benefit from treatment. As such, a useful estimate of the expected rate is the national average.  Radical radiotherapy for head and neck cancer can result in life-threatening side-effects, particularly when combined with systemic anti-cancer therapy. Equally, it must be recognised that patients with head and neck cancer often suffer with other significant medical conditions which either alone, or in combination with cancer treatment, can lead to death within 90 days of the start of radical radiotherapy. The metric does not incorporate baseline patient characteristics (such as cancer stage, age or co-morbidity) or distinguish between treatment related and co-morbidity related death. Consequently, a provider with high use of radical radiotherapy (sometimes referred to as more aggressive treatment decision-making) may be found to have higher than expected 90-day mortality in the same way as one where support services are less robust than necessary. As such, where a provider is identified as outlying, there is a need to consider these factors when considering how best to incorporate this information into future decision-making and service planning. In all cases, an NHS Trust could be identified as an outlier due to data quality issues.

### Crude 90-day mortality rates {-}

Crude 90-day mortality after radical radiotherapy rates represent the observed proportion of patients treated with radical radiotherapy who died within 90 days of the start date of their first radiotherapy episode in a year. This is calculated for each NHS Trust on the radiotherapy episode data submitted to RTDS. This calculation does not take into account factors that may be associated with variation in mortality rate e.g. fractionation, age etc. As such, crude rates are not recommended for directly comparing 90-day mortality rates between NHS Trusts.

## Interpreting the funnel plot {-}

### Funnel plot content {-}

The funnel plot is used to visualise the 90-day mortality rates for the included NHS Trusts. The components of a funnel plot are listed below with a short description. 

-   Each data point represents a NHS Trust
-   Horizontal axis = the number of episodes included in the analysis for each NHS Trust
-   Vertical axis = the calculated crude 90-day mortality rate
-   Solid horizontal line = the average crude 90-day mortality rate for all NHS Trusts, calculated from all episodes included in the analysis. This is the England average
-   Dashed lines = the 2 standard deviations control limits (&asymp; &pm; 95% control limits)
-   Dotted lines = the 3 standard deviations control limits (&asymp; &pm; 99.8% control limits)


### Control Limits and Outliers {-}

Control limits define the statistical upper and lower limits within which variation can be expected to fall given the number of episodes observed (this recognises that with smaller numbers of episodes the expected variation will be greater). Points which fall outside of these limits indicate unexpected variation. The 3 standard deviation (SD) control limits imply that 99.8% of all NHS Trusts are expected to be within that range. An adjusted rate outside the 3SD control limits would correspond to the rate being statistically significantly different from English average rate (at a two-sided significance level of 0.002). 

The control limits are calculated from the England average rate, varying in line with the observed number of episodes per NHS Trust. Control limits are presented for crude 90-day mortality funnel plots but __only Trusts with adjusted 90-day mortality falling outside the 3 standard deviation (99.8%) control limits are identified as outliers__:

-   NHS Trusts with adjusted 90-day mortality greater than the upper 3SD (99.8%) control limit are defined as a "High Outlier"
-   NHS Trusts with adjusted 90-day mortality less than the lower 3SD (99.8%) control limit are defined as a "Low Outlier"


NHS Trusts that are identified as outliers for the adjusted 90-day mortality will be notified of this. All NHS Trusts are given the opportunity to respond to the RTDS team prior to this information being published on CancerStats2.
